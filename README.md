# Spin the Wheel Game for teachers

The database is an excel file, each new column is a roulette wheel, with the first row as the title, and it can grow infinitely.

I chose the Excel format due to security and technology limitations of the company, besides any teacher can edit it .

If you have any dount, feel free to pull a request and I'll be happy to help.
